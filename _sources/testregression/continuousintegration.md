Continuous Integration
================

Continuous Integration (CI), is a software development technique where all developers send their code to a central repository. There it passes through a process of build and testing. Its objectives are find and investigate bugs quicker and therefore enhance code quality and also diminishing the time it takes to validate and release new features. 

## Why is it necessary?

Before, developers teams could work separately for longs periods of time and then join their code to the master branch when they're done. Many problems may occur this way. It took time to do so, and many bugs where accumulated and kept there for a long time. This practice made difficult to distribute the code fast to clients. There is where Continuous Integration comes to action. 

## How does it work?

Normally, developers use a version control system, such as git. Before submitted their code to code repositories such as GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab, for example. A CI server is integrated with these code buckets in order to run the tests automatically, alongside with building the system, and may display errors right away. 
This way, the code changes are created, tested and prepared automatically, so that the production are liberated. 

## Why it helps?

- Enhance developers productivity.
It makes the team more productive once the CI process is all made automatically.

- With tests being made more often, bugs are discovered earlier, before scaling.

- Features are released more often 

**Some examples of Continuous Integration Servers**
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

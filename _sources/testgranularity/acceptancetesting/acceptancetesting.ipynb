Acceptance Testing has the purpose of evaluating the application and determine whether the software system has met the requirements specifications. It means that the test determines if the system is ready for release or not. \n","\n","During this phase of testing, the user will test the system to find out whether the application meets their business needs. The results can give the customer the security that the application has the required features and behaves as expected. Resuming, acceptance tests represent the customer’s interests.\n","\n","![Development Process vs Testing Strategies](https://ds6br8f5qp1u2.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/types-uat-testing-2.png)\n","\n","There are different types of acceptance tests, like Alpha & Beta Testing, Contract Acceptance Testing, Regulation Acceptance Testing, and Operational Acceptance Testing. All of these tests are done before the software is released to all customers. The difference between them is the specifications that the test must validate, for example, regulation acceptance tests are to certificate the software is filling specific rules and regulations.\n","\n","There is a difference between acceptance tests and functional testing. The acceptance tests verify if the specific requirements are working for the user, it means, the costumer and the stakeholders have to agree on the product. On the other hand, the functional testing validates the specific requirements and specifications of the software, but does not mean that it actually work for the user. \n","\n","## Benefits to Acceptance Tests \n","The preservation of those tests by running frequently and maintaining them update can deliver good results for a software development team, as:\n","- Validates that business requirements are met as defined in user stories\n","- Encourages closer collaboration between developers and client/stakeholders\n","- Reduces the risk of finding defects post-production and regression bugs\n","- Identify problems which unit or integration tests might have missed\n","\n","## Hands On\n","\n","Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. The BDD advantage is that the test cases can be written in a common language, such as English, so details of how the application behaves can be understood by all members of the team.\n","\n","[behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python code.\n","\n","### Installation using pip\n","\n","Execute the following command to install behave with pip:"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"tags":[]},"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install behave"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To update an already installed behave version, use:"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -U behave"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","See also pip related information for installing Python packages.\n","\n","to see other forms of installation visit: [https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n","\n","You must install [PyHamcrest](https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/), it will provide functions to validate our test result, such as assert and equal.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install PyHamcrest"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","### Cretate Your Scenarios\n","Now make a directory called “features”.

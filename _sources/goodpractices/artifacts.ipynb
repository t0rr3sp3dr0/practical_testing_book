In practice, test code bases tend to grow quickly. Empirically, we have been observing that Lehman's laws of evolution also apply to test code: code tends to rot, unless one actively works against it. Therefore, as with production code, developers have to put extra effort into making high-quality test code bases, so that these can be maintained and developed in a sustainable way."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before jumping into how not to write your tests, we would like to go over a few good practices really quick. There are five basic rules that every test should obey to be considered a good — or even a valid — test. There is a mnemonic for these five rules: F.I.R.S.T. defined in the book Clean Code[1] tests should be:\n\n- Fast — tests should execute quickly so the test suite can be executed often.\n- Isolated — tests on their own cannot depend on external factors or on the result of another test.\n- Repeatable — tests should have the same result every time we run them.\n- Self-verifying — tests should include assertions; no human intervention needed.\n- Timely — tests should be written along with the production code.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Most commom bad practices in writting test cases"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we’ll dive into a few examples of bad practices and how to deal with them."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Magic Number Test**\nIn this first example, we have a function that calculates the body mass index (BMI) and the test works just fine but, but, I can feel something is not clear, take a look at it."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import unittest\n \ndef calculateBmi(weight,height):\n bmi = weight/(height * height)\n \n return round(bmi,2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class TestCalculateBmi(unittest.TestCase):\n \n def test_calculate_Bmi(self):\n   self.assertEqual(calculateBmi(80,1.70),27.68)\n \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   unittest.main(argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'], exit=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this test method, it is not known the significance of the numeric literals that was passed as parameter in the assertion method, we should modify it to make clear what is the meaning of this value."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class TestCalculateBmi(unittest.TestCase):\n    \n    def test_calculate_Bmi(self):\n       bmi = 27.68\n       weight = 80\n       height = 1.70\n       self.assertEqual(calculateBmi(weight,height),bmi)\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n   unittest.main(argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'], exit=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Assertion Roulette**\nDiving a little deeper, we now have an example a bit more complex.

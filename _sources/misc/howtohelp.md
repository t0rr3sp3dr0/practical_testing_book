How To Help
===========

The book can be edited by *anyone* willing to make a Pull Request (PR) to this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book):

Essentials about editing the book:

* This is a [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html). 
    * The structure of the book is determined by the file \_toc.yml sitting in the root directory.

    * There are two file formats we use for the contents: .md .pynb. The first extension is for markdown files whereas the second extension is for Python (Jupyter) Notebooks. Markdown blocks are typically added within Jupyter notebooks.<br><br>

* Two scripts determine how to build and deploy the book: build.sh and deploy.sh. 
  
  * The first script builds the static web site (under directory \_build) whereas the second script deploys the static pages on a GitHub page branch (gh-pages). Unless you are a member of the project repository, you will *not* be able to use this script. If you want to contribute, send us a PR.<br><br>

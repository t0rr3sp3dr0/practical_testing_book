Model-Based Testing
===================

A model-based testing is an approach to testing based on creating a model to be used to automate the testing process. In this approach a model is basically a description of a system expected behaviour. There are many way from which those models can be described such as input sequences, actions, conditions, output and flow of data from input to output. From these models are derived and executed automated tests and itâ€™s result document.

## What is a model

Creating a model means converting your system functionality and expected behavior into a mathematical model that represents it. For that so, there are many models used for this purpose. Some of these models are:

*   Finite State Machine
*   State Charts
*   Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Transforming a system into one of these models has a huge importance for software testing. Besides turning able to translate these models to create automated tests having these precise translations guarantee to the developer that the system works as intended as those models are very specific for defining functionalities.


## Advantages of using model-based testing 

Advantages of using model-based testing 

As the demand for software with a high level of complexity increases the necessity for developing tests for those softwares increases to. A huge problem with these consequence is how long the process of creation execution and verification of test takes. Considering that, the usage of model-based testing shows a huge relevance due to the automation of most parts of this process.

To put into perspective the difference between testing software by hand, using scripts to automate the tests and using model-based testing considering the parameters of:

*   making the specification of the system
*   create the tests
*   predict the outcome
*   execute the test
*   check the outcome 

Model-based testing is the only of those three that automates the whole process with the exception of creating the system specification. In the day-to-day of software development this represent a huge saving on the time developing the software.	Besides that the creation of a mathematical model to represent the system, necessary for the model-based testing, also increases the strictness of the testing and decreases the cost of maintenance of the tests.

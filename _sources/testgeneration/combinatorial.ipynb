        "Nowadays, software systems are complex and can have multiple possible configurations, for example, an application can have multiple target operating systems, execute in various types of hardware, and in multiple resolutions. But also those applications can have multiple states which they are in.\n",
        "Those multiple parameters for a system cause different behaviors alone and when combined, so multiple combinations of a system’s parameters must be tested to achieve optimal test coverage, and catch errors that wouldn't be detected executing simple tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of an application that can have multiple possible configurations, is a mobile application, that can execute in multiple types of cellphone and in multiple possible states. A example of possible parameters {cite}`combinatorialexample` for a mobile application are:\n",

        "| Parameter   | Options                       |\n",
        "|-------------|-------------------------------|\n",

        "| Screen Size | 1080x1920, 750x1334, 720x1280 |\n",
        "\n",
        "Using those parameters, we can calculate the list of possible parameter combinations multiplying the number of options for each parameter:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "    Number of configuration combinations = 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 combinations of parameters\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "With a small quantity of parameters and options, this number is already big. But as the number of parameters and its possible values raise, the number of possible combinations rises exponentially, making it impossible to exhaustively test the software, given the time and budget constraints often existent on software projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "A way to overcome those limitations is by using Combinatorial Testing, a method for software testing that for some input parameters, tests possible discrete combinations of those parameters, generating those combinations by systematically covering t-way interactions between parameters {cite}`combinatorialsurvey`, the \"t\" being called the degree of interaction, this set of combinations is called a *covering array*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most popular *degree of interaction* used in combinatorial testing is t = 2, that is, it generate combinations that all parameter interact a least once with each other, this type of combinatorial testing is called *PairWise testing*, using the previous example a *covering array* generated by this technique would look like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "As we can see, *PairWise testing* generates half of the combinations needed for the brute force aproach, producing high-quality testing at a lower cost because it provides a smarter way for testing using only a subset of the possible parameter combinations. \n",
        "\n",
        "Also, combinatorial testing is a very simple technique to apply, as it is based on the specification, it is enough to specify a system's parameters and its possible values, and the combinatorial testing tool will generate an *covering array* to test the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Choosing a degree of interaction\n",
        "Constructing a Combinatorial Testing suite, we have to specify the input parameters and values, but there’s an important parameter we must think about: the degree of interaction. A degree of interaction t means that we want to test the t-way interaction of our parameters, that is, we want to test all combinations of t parameters.\t\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the value chosen for \"t\", the process of generating the input can be more or less computationally complex but also can achieve more or less fault coverage. Increasing the value for \"t\" will increase the fault coverage, but also will increase the cost for generating and executing the tests, getting to a point that's almost no gain in coverage as the \"t\"  increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, you would want to choose a degree of interaction that gives you an appropriate level of confidence but doesn't make the process of testing to costly. The creators of ACTS, a popular tool for combinatorial testing, have done research on the relation of the degree of interactions and software failures. They found that most of the bugs studied were caused by an interaction of at most 6 different parameters {cite}`actscombinatorial`:\n",

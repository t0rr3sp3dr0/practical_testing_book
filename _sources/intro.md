Introduction
============

This is a book about Software Testing.

Highlights:

- The book adopts the minimalistic principle, meaning...

	Less text and more
tutorials, quizzes, and exercises.<br><br>

- The book is for anyone with basic experience in programming.<br><br>

- The book adopts Python as its Programming Language. 

	The choice was based on language popularity.<br><br>

- The book uses [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for
increased interaction with the reader. 

 	With those notebooks, the
reader will be able to execute code and observe outputs and and will
be able to change the code (if she wants) to observe impact of the
change.<br><br>

- The book is in constant change (just as software).
